The SUMMARY notes it MUST be applied with motion-safe: prefix, but Hero.js uses the bare bg-neon animate-pulse2 class without the motion-safe: variant — so the pulsing dot in the hero badge bypasses the Tailwind motion-safe gate. The CSS !important rule does still suppress it at the stylesheet level, so this is partial rather than fully failed."

  - test: "Reduce Motion suppression end-to-end"
    expected: "With OS Reduce Motion ON, the pulsing dot in the hero badge is completely static — no pulse animation plays at any point"
    why_human: "The CSS !important rule in index.css should suppress pulse2 even without the motion-safe: prefix, but this needs visual confirmation that the browser actually respects the media query in this rendering context."

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `npm run dev` starts Vite dev server; `npm run build` produces production bundle | VERIFIED | Build exits 0 in 644ms; dist/assets/ contains .js, .css, and all woff/woff2 font files |
| 2 | App renders with new bold color palette — neon cyan/purple is gone | FAILED | 7/8 components still reference `text-neon`, `bg-neon`, `bg-grad-neon`, `shadow-neon`, `text-slate2-*` — tokens not defined in tailwind.config.js |
| 3 | Self-hosted fonts load from local bundle — no Google Fonts CDN | VERIFIED | `googleapis.com` absent from index.html and public/; @fontsource/inter and @fontsource/jetbrains-mono imported in src/index.js; woff2 files present in dist/assets/ |
| 4 | `npm run lint` completes with no ESLint errors or missing-plugin warnings | VERIFIED | Output: "0 errors, 6 warnings" — warnings are intentional pre-existing issues documented in 01-03-SUMMARY.md |
| 5 | Animations fully suppressed when OS Reduce Motion is enabled | PARTIAL | Global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rule present in src/index.css with `!important`; however Hero.js uses bare `animate-pulse2` (not `motion-safe:animate-pulse2`), bypassing the Tailwind variant gate |

**Score:** 3/5 truths verified (1 failed, 1 partial — counted as not fully verified)

## Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `src/components/Hero.js` | `text-neon`, `bg-neon`, `bg-grad-neon`, `shadow-neon`, `shadow-[0_0_12px_#00E5A8]`, `text-slate2-100`, `text-slate2-400` — undefined Tailwind tokens | Blocker | Colors silently drop; hero renders without intended visual design |
| `src/components/Nav.js` | `text-neon`, `bg-grad-neon`, `text-slate2-100`, `text-slate2-400` — undefined tokens | Blocker | Nav renders without brand colors |
| `src/components/About.js` | `text-neon`, `bg-neon`, `text-slate2-100`, `text-slate2-400` — undefined tokens | Blocker | About section renders without palette |
| `src/components/Skill.js` | `text-neon`, `bg-neon`, `shadow-neon`, `hover:border-neon`, `text-slate2-100`, `text-slate2-400` — undefined tokens | Blocker | Skills section renders without palette |
| `src/components/Experience.js` | `text-neon`, `border-neon`, `shadow-[...#00E5A8]`, `text-slate2-100`, `text-slate2-400` — undefined tokens + hardcoded neon hex | Blocker | Experience renders without palette; hardcoded #00E5A8 is the specific old neon color |
| `src/components/Contact.js` | `text-neon`, `hover:border-neon`, `text-slate2-100`, `text-slate2-400` — undefined tokens | Blocker | Contact section renders without palette |
| `src/components/Footer.js` | `text-neon`, `text-slate2-100`, `text-slate2-400` — undefined tokens | Blocker | Footer renders without palette |
| `src/components/Hero.js:12` | `animate-pulse2` without `motion-safe:` prefix | Warning | Bypasses Tailwind reduced-motion variant gate (CSS fallback still applies via !important) |

Note on stub classification: These are genuine rendering blockers, not test fixtures or initial state. Tailwind JIT generates no CSS for undefined utility names — the classes produce no visual output.

## Human Verification Required

### 1. Visual Palette Render

**Test:** Open `npm run dev` in a browser and inspect Nav, Hero, About, Skills, Experience, Contact, and Footer sections.
**Expected:** All sections display indigo/violet brand colors (#6C63FF) and coral accents (#FF6B6B). No cyan glow or neon tones visible. Text reads in the off-white (#F0F0FF) text-primary scale.
**Why human:** Tailwind silently discards unknown utility classes at build time. The build succeeds regardless. Only a browser render reveals whether components are receiving the new palette or rendering with no color intent at all.

### 2. Reduce Motion — Hero Pulse Badge

**Test:** Enable OS "Reduce Motion" (macOS: System Settings > Accessibility > Display > Reduce Motion). Load the dev server. Observe the pulsing dot in the hero "Available for opportunities" badge.
**Expected:** The dot is fully static — no animation of any kind plays.
**Why human:** The CSS `!important` rule in index.css should suppress the animation even though Hero.js uses bare `animate-pulse2`. Confirming the !important path actually wins in the browser for this specific case requires visual inspection.

## Gaps Summary

**Gap 1 — Color palette not applied to components (CRITICAL):** The new design token system is correctly built in tailwind.config.js and src/index.css. However, the component sweep from old neon/slate2 tokens to new ink/brand/accent/text tokens was not completed. The 01-02-SUMMARY.md explicitly notes: "Component sweep of old neon references deferred to Phase 2/3 — App.js only updated in Phase 1." This intentional deferral means the design system exists but is not actually rendered in the app. The phase goal "new design system ready for building on top of" is ambiguous — the infrastructure is ready, but the visual output does not demonstrate the new palette.

The specific blocker for Truth #2 ("neon cyan/purple is gone") is that `text-neon`, `bg-neon`, `bg-grad-neon`, `shadow-neon`, `text-slate2-100`, and `text-slate2-400` appear in 7 component files. These tokens are not in tailwind.config.js, so Tailwind generates no CSS for them. The old #00E5A8 neon cyan also appears hardcoded as a shadow value in Experience.js.

**Gap 2 — motion-safe: prefix not enforced in Hero.js (MINOR):** The pulse2 animation in the hero badge uses bare `animate-pulse2` rather than `motion-safe:animate-pulse2`. The CSS !important fallback likely still works, but this is a latent correctness issue that the tailwind.config.js comment explicitly warns against.

**Root cause of both gaps:** The 01-02-SUMMARY.md and 01-04-SUMMARY.md both documented these as intentional deferrals ("deferred to Phase 2/3"). However, Truth #2 from the Phase 1 success criteria ("the dated neon cyan/purple is gone") cannot be satisfied with deferred component sweeps — the neon classes are still present in every component.

**Recommendation for re-plan:** A minimal gap-closure plan targeting the component token sweep should be inserted before Phase 2 begins. It is a mechanical find-and-replace across 7 files: neon → brand, slate2-100 → text-primary, slate2-400 → text-secondary, grad-neon → brand-gradient, shadow-neon → shadow-brand. Estimated effort: under 30 minutes. This unblocks Truth #2 and DSGN-01.
