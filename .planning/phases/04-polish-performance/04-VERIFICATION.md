# Phase 04: Polish & Performance Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** The site earns Lighthouse 90+ on mobile and feels flawless on every real device.
**Verified:** 2026-05-05
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Lighthouse Performance 90+ mobile with throttling | VERIFIED | Lighthouse CLI run 2026-05-08 produced Performance 0.98 (98), Accessibility 1.00 (100), target-size 1.0. Report in 04-06-LIGHTHOUSE-REPORT.md. |
| 2 | All interactive elements meet 44px tap target | VERIFIED | Lighthouse target-size audit = 1.0 (pass). Contact.js copy button has `min-h-[44px]` at line 90. Lighthouse A11y 100 confirms no tap-target violations across all interactive elements. |
| 3 | Full-page scroll on mid-range Android no jank (Chrome Performance profile per D-09) | HUMAN NEEDED | Chrome DevTools Performance profile has NOT been recorded — 04-07-PERF-PROFILE.md documents the procedure with blank findings fields. Lighthouse TBT 100ms is a strong proxy but D-09 explicitly requires a recorded profile. |

**Score:** 2/3 truths verified

## Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `App.js` SkipLink | `#main` landmark | `href="#main"` + `<main id="main">` | WIRED | Both ends present and matching |
| `App.js` | Experience/Contact/Footer | `React.lazy` + `Suspense` | WIRED | 3 lazy imports + 3 Suspense wrappers confirmed |
| `src/index.js` | font preload | `?url` import + `preloadWoff2()` forEach | WIRED | URL imports feed function that injects `<link>` into `document.head` |
| `vite.config.js` | `dist/stats.html` | `visualizer({ filename: 'dist/stats.html' })` | WIRED | stats.html confirmed in dist/ |
| `Skill.js` ChipBadge | `inView` gate | `animate-on-scroll${inView ? ' is-visible' : ''}` | WIRED | No hardcoded `is-visible` escape hatch; all 3 chip/category renders gated on section `inView` |
| `Experience.js` header | `headerInView` | separate `useInView(headerRef)` | WIRED | `headerRef` attached to heading container div; `headerInView` drives `is-visible` class |

## Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

Not applicable — this phase delivers performance/a11y infrastructure, not new data-rendering components. All dynamic data sources (EXPERIENCE array, translations) pre-exist from prior phases and are unchanged.

---

## Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Lazy chunks exist in dist/ | `ls dist/assets/*.js` | 4 files: index + Contact + Experience + Footer | PASS |
| font-display: swap active | `grep font-display node_modules/@fontsource/inter/400.css` | `font-display: swap` (multiple occurrences) | PASS |
| bundle visualizer output | `ls dist/stats.html` | File exists | PASS |
| Inter 500/600/700 stripped | `grep "inter/500\|inter/600\|inter/700" src/index.js` | No output | PASS |
| No test infra added (D-04) | `grep "vitest\|@testing-library" package.json` | No output | PASS |
| Chrome DevTools perf scroll | (requires interactive browser) | Not run | SKIP |
| 4-breakpoint responsive sweep | (requires Chrome DevTools device toolbar) | Not run | SKIP |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| SEO-03 | Lighthouse Performance 90+ on mobile with throttling | SATISFIED | Lighthouse CLI: Performance 0.98. Report: 04-06-LIGHTHOUSE-REPORT.md. |
| RESP-01 | Mobile-first responsive design flawless at phones/tablets/desktop | NEEDS HUMAN | Code targets 4 breakpoints per D-08; visual verification deferred to UAT (04-07-PERF-PROFILE.md checklist). |
| RESP-02 | All animations smooth on mobile, no jank | NEEDS HUMAN | Lighthouse TBT 100ms is proxy evidence; Chrome DevTools Performance profile not yet recorded per D-09. |
| RESP-03 | Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44px) on all interactive elements | SATISFIED | Lighthouse target-size audit = 1.0 (pass). Contact.js `min-h-[44px]` confirmed at line 90. |

---

## Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| None | — | — | — | No placeholder, stub, or hardcoded empty data patterns found in any phase-modified file |

Notes:
- `Experience.js` line 93 uses `key={j}` (array index) — flagged `react/no-array-index-key: warn` in ESLint. This is a pre-existing pattern explicitly allowed by `.eslintrc.js` and does not affect goal achievement.
- `useActiveSection.js` `ids.join('|')` exhaustive-deps suppression is intentional per CONTEXT.md and not a stub.

---

## Human Verification Required

### 1. Chrome DevTools Performance Profile (RESP-02 / must-have #3)

**Test:** Open `http://localhost:4173` in Chrome after `npm run build && npx vite preview --port=4173`. DevTools -> Performance tab -> CPU 4x slowdown + Network Slow 4G. Record 5-10s of continuous scroll from Hero to Footer.

**Expected:**
- FPS bar mostly green (55-60 FPS); yellow < 1s acceptable; no red
- No long tasks > 50ms flagged
- No layout thrash during sustained scroll
- `useInView` observers fire once per section then go silent
- `useActiveSection` scroll-spy fires only at section-edge crossings

**Why human:** Chrome DevTools cannot be driven headlessly. Lighthouse TBT 100ms is proxy evidence (strong signal) but D-09 requires an actual recorded profile.

### 2. Responsive Sweep — 4 Breakpoints (RESP-01)

**Test:** DevTools device toolbar -> cycle through: iPhone 14 (390x844), Pixel 7 (412x915), iPad (768x1024), 4K desktop (2560x1440). Scroll full page at each.

**Expected:** No horizontal overflow; hamburger nav visible at mobile / desktop nav at md:; Stats 2-col mobile / 4-col desktop; Timeline rail aligned; chips wrap without overflow; Contact Copy button reachable and 44px at all breakpoints.

**Why human:** Requires Chrome DevTools device toolbar interaction; not automatable via CLI.

### 3. Skip-link Keyboard Flow

**Test:** Tab from browser address bar once -> skip-link appears top-left -> press Enter -> page scrolls to and focuses `#main`.

**Expected:** Focus ring visible on skip-link; Enter moves focus to `#main` landmark.

**Why human:** Requires interactive keyboard navigation in browser.

### 4. Reduce-Motion Override

**Test:** System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Reduce Motion ON -> reload site -> scroll all sections.

**Expected:** All `.animate-on-scroll` elements start fully visible (opacity 1, no translateY); Hero char-reveal omitted; no chip stagger. Turn off after testing.

**Why human:** Requires OS-level setting toggle and visual inspection.

---

## Gaps Summary

No automated gaps. All code-verifiable deliverables are present and correctly wired:

- W-01 (Skill.js ChipBadge inView gate): implemented and gated on real `inView` state
- I-01 (Experience.js header animate-on-scroll): implemented with separate `headerRef` / `headerInView`
- D-06 (Contact copy button 44px): `min-h-[44px]` confirmed
- D-07 (jsx-a11y to error): all 4 rules promoted
- D-04 (no test infra): constraint honored
- Font optimization (2 weights): only 400+800 imported
- Font preload: `?url` + DOM injection in place
- Code splitting: 3 lazy chunks in dist/
- Bundle visualizer: wired and producing stats.html
- Skip-to-content: SkipLink component, CSS, translations (EN+ES), `<main id="main">` all wired

The `human_needed` status reflects D-09 (Performance profile) and D-08 (responsive sweep) being explicitly deferred to manual UAT — not a code deficiency. Lighthouse 98 + TBT 100ms + target-size 1.0 provide strong automated evidence for the performance and tap-target criteria.
