    why_human: "Keyboard event handler wired correctly in code (line 158 Nav.js) but end-to-end key behavior requires live browser"
  - test: "Click a nav link (e.g. About) — verify page smooth-scrolls to that section, then scroll manually — verify active link highlights"

    expected: "Seven animation steps with motion-safe: Tailwind prefix play; elements start opacity-0 then animate in; users with prefers-reduced-motion see content immediately without animation"

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Hero section visible on first load with name, role, tagline, CTA buttons — staggered entrance animations play automatically | VERIFIED (code) / HUMAN (visual) | Hero.js renders t.hero.h1a/h1b/h1c, lead, cta1, CV EN/ES buttons, 4-stat grid; 7 animation steps with animationDelay 0–950ms and motion-safe: prefixes confirmed at lines 64–137 |
| 2 | On phone, tapping hamburger opens full-screen menu overlay; body does not scroll behind it; ESC or close tap dismisses it | VERIFIED (code) / HUMAN (runtime) | MobileMenu via createPortal(overlay, document.body) at Nav.js line 219; document.body.style.overflow='hidden' at line 156; ESC handler at line 158–160; onClose tap at line 187–189 |
| 3 | Clicking nav link smooth-scrolls to target section; nav highlights active section as user scrolls | VERIFIED (code) / HUMAN (runtime) | scroll-behavior:smooth in index.css line 30; href="#${l.id}" links at Nav.js lines 75 and 207; useActiveSection IntersectionObserver with rootMargin '-20% 0px -60% 0px' at useActiveSection.js lines 22–24; active class text-brand border-b-2 border-brand applied at Nav.js lines 72 and 202 |
| 4 | Switching EN/ES updates all visible text instantly; choice persists after page reload | VERIFIED (code) / HUMAN (runtime) | LanguageContext.js: lazy init via useState(readInitialLang) at line 19; localStorage.getItem('cam-lang') at line 12; localStorage.setItem at line 36; t: translations[lang] memoized in useMemo at line 43; all section components consume t via useLanguage() |
| 5 | CV download buttons offer both EN and ES Word documents for download | VERIFIED | Hero.js lines 119–130: href="/CV_Carlos_Montoya_EN.docx" download and href="/CV_Carlos_Montoya_ES.docx" download; files confirmed at public/CV_Carlos_Montoya_EN.docx and public/CV_Carlos_Montoya_ES.docx |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified in code; 4 truths additionally require live browser verification

### Design Decision Compliance

| Decision | Description | Status | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------|
| D-01 | In-place modify existing components | HONORED | Nav.js and Hero.js replace original files; no new top-level components added |
| D-02 | Native scroll-behavior:smooth (no react-scroll) | HONORED | scroll-behavior:smooth at index.css line 30; react-scroll absent from package.json |
| D-03 | Custom IntersectionObserver hook (no library) | HONORED | src/hooks/useActiveSection.js — pure IO hook, no external library |
| D-04 | react-scroll and react-router-dom removed | HONORED | Both absent from package.json and package-lock.json; 0 imports in src/ |
| D-05 | createPortal to document.body for MobileMenu | HONORED | Nav.js line 2 imports createPortal; line 219 renders to document.body |
| D-06 | No test infra — manual browser verification | HONORED | No test files in phase; 5 items routed to human verification |
| D-07 | menuOpen/menuClose i18n keys | HONORED | Both keys present in en.nav and es.nav in translations.js |

---

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| Nav.js | 167 | `return null` in MobileMenu | INFO | Guard for SSR (typeof document === 'undefined') — correct defensive pattern, not a stub |

No blocker or warning anti-patterns found. The `return null` on line 167 is a legitimate SSR guard before the createPortal call, not a placeholder.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Mobile hamburger overlay + scroll lock

**Test:** On a phone or browser devtools mobile viewport, tap the hamburger icon.
**Expected:** Full-screen overlay appears covering 100% viewport; attempting to scroll the background page is blocked (overflow:hidden on body); close button and ESC both dismiss the menu.
**Why human:** `document.body.style.overflow='hidden'` is confirmed in code (Nav.js line 156) but real scroll-lock behavior requires the browser to honor it — not verifiable via grep.

#### 2. ESC key dismissal

**Test:** While mobile menu is open, press the ESC key.
**Expected:** Menu closes; `document.body.style.overflow` is restored to ''.
**Why human:** Keyboard event listener on `document` is wired at Nav.js line 158–160 but runtime key dispatch requires a live browser session.

#### 3. Smooth-scroll + active nav highlighting

**Test:** Click the "Experience" nav link; then manually scroll through all sections.
**Expected:** Page smooth-scrolls (animated, not instant jump) to the experience section; as each section enters the central viewport band the corresponding nav link gains the brand-colored underline; leaving removes it.
**Why human:** CSS `scroll-behavior:smooth` and IntersectionObserver rootMargin behavior must be observed in a running browser — not inferable from static code.

#### 4. Language switch + persistence

**Test:** Switch from EN to ES via the LangPill; verify all text changes. Reload the page.
**Expected:** All visible copy switches to Spanish immediately with no layout shift; after reload the page renders in Spanish without an EN flash.
**Why human:** React re-render on context update and localStorage synchronous read are code-verified but the absence of a language flash requires a real paint cycle to confirm.

#### 5. Entrance animations + reduced-motion

**Test:** Load the page fresh and observe the hero section; also load with OS reduced-motion setting enabled.
**Expected:** Normal: badge fades in at 0ms, h1a slides up at 150ms, h1b char-reveals from 300ms, h1c slides at 500ms, lead at 650ms, CTAs at 800ms, stats at 950ms. Reduced-motion: all elements appear immediately with no animation; char-reveal completes instantly (useCharReveal returns full target string).
**Why human:** CSS animation timing and the `motion-safe:` Tailwind prefix behavior require visual inspection; `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` path in useCharReveal (line 15–18) is code-verified but needs a real media query match to confirm.

---

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 5 success criteria are fully implemented in code. The 5 human verification items are not gaps — they are runtime behaviors that require a live browser to confirm. All structural, wiring, data-flow, and anti-pattern checks pass.

The phase goal is achieved: Nav.js and Hero.js together constitute a bold, animated hero with a functional bilingual navigation. The design direction contract is locked in code.
