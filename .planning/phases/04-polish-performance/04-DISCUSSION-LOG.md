## Claude's Discretion

- Which sections get React.lazy split
- Exact font-display value if @fontsource doesn't already set swap
- Skip-to-content link copy + position
- Tailwind purge / arbitrary value cleanup
- Vite manualChunks config
- Image format strategy (AVIF/WebP picture)
- Specific font preload strategy (2 vs 5 weights)
- jsx-a11y warning resolution per category

## Deferred Ideas

- Test infrastructure (post-v3.4)
- JSON-LD Person schema (backlog)
- Sitemap (backlog)
- AVIF picture fallback (backlog)
- BrowserStack cross-device (backlog)
- Real Android phone perf (backlog)
- Visual regression (backlog)
- REQUIREMENTS traceability sync (milestone audit)
- Deploy target (milestone-level)
- Domain registration (milestone-level)
