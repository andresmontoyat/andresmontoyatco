# Phase 06: Projects Showcase Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Visitors can browse 3-5 of Carlos's curated projects in a dedicated section that flows naturally between Experience and Contact.
**Verified:** 2026-05-05
**Status:** human_needed — all automated checks pass; 3 success criteria require browser confirmation
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `#projects` nav link scroll-spies and `href="#projects"` exists in DesktopNav + MobileMenu | ? HUMAN NEEDED | SECTION_IDS includes 'projects' (Nav.js:7); `href="#projects"` present in both link arrays (Nav.js:67, 175); scroll-spy wired via useActiveSection — runtime behavior needs browser |
| 2 | Each card renders title/desc/tech chips/screenshot-slot/conditional Live+GitHub buttons | ✓ VERIFIED | Projects.js:41-108 — ProjectCard renders all fields; conditional render at lines 81-104 gates buttons on liveUrl/githubUrl truthiness |
| 3 | Cards legible in dark + light at iPhone14/iPad/1440px | ? HUMAN NEEDED | Responsive grid classes present (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3); theme tokens bg-ink-500/text-text-primary/text-text-secondary used — visual legibility requires browser |
| 4 | Screenshots load from public/projects/ without CLS; missing screenshots show brand-gradient placeholder | ? HUMAN NEEDED | aspect-video wrapper on line 47 reserves space; brand-gradient fallback implemented at lines 56-60; CLS measurement needs browser |
| 5 | Cards animate via existing useInView pattern (no new lib) | ✓ VERIFIED | Projects.js imports useInView from `../hooks/useInView` (line 3); animate-on-scroll class with is-visible toggle on grid (line 30); stagger via `style={{ transitionDelay: \`${index * 100}ms\` }}` (line 44); no new animation library imported |

**Score:** 5/5 truths have implementation evidence — 2 fully verified statically, 3 require browser confirmation

## Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `src/components/Projects.js` | `src/data/projects.js` | `import + PROJECTS.map` | ✓ WIRED | Line 5: `import PROJECTS from '../data/projects'`; line 32: `PROJECTS.map((p, i) => ...)` |
| `src/components/Projects.js` | `src/hooks/useInView.js` | hook + animate-on-scroll class toggle | ✓ WIRED | Line 3: `import useInView from '../hooks/useInView'`; lines 10,12: two useInView calls; animate-on-scroll + is-visible toggled on lines 19, 30 |
| `src/components/Projects.js` | `src/i18n/translations.js` | `useLanguage() -> t.projects.*` | ✓ WIRED | Line 2: useLanguage import; line 8: `const { lang, t } = useLanguage()`; t.projects.label/h2/intro/live/github all referenced |
| `src/components/Nav.js` | SECTION_IDS scroll-spy | `'projects'` in array | ✓ WIRED | SECTION_IDS at line 7 includes 'projects'; passed to useActiveSection (line 12); activeSection compared in both link renderers |

## Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

| Artifact | Data Variable | Source | Produces Real Data | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|--------------------|--------|
| `Projects.js` | `PROJECTS` (array of 4 entries) | `src/data/projects.js` (static module) | Yes — 4 substantive bilingual entries with real content derived from experience | ✓ FLOWING |
| `Projects.js` | `t.projects.*` | `src/i18n/translations.js` via useLanguage() | Yes — all 5 keys (label/h2/intro/live/github) present in EN and ES branches | ✓ FLOWING |
| `Projects.js` | `lang` | LanguageContext (localStorage + navigator.language) | Yes — existing pattern used by all sections | ✓ FLOWING |

Note: All data is static (no async fetch). This is correct for this project architecture — no DB queries expected.

## Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| useInView hook exports a function | `node -e "const m=require('./src/hooks/useInView.js')" 2>&1` | N/A (ESM module) | ? SKIP — ESM, not runnable via node directly |
| Projects lazy chunk emitted in dist | `ls dist/assets/Projects-*.js` | `Projects-DucOh_hO.js` found | ✓ PASS |
| PROJECTS has 4 entries with required fields | grep count on projects.js | 4 slug entries, 4 tech entries, export default PROJECTS | ✓ PASS |
| translations.js has all 5 projects keys in EN + ES | grep on translations.js | label/h2/intro/live/github confirmed in both branches | ✓ PASS |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| VIS-03 | 06-01-PLAN, 06-02-PLAN | Visitors can browse curated projects in a dedicated section | ✓ SATISFIED | Projects section component implemented with 4 real entries; wired into nav and app composition; lazy chunk emitted; conditional buttons and brand-gradient fallback implemented |

---

## Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `src/data/projects.js` | 8, 18, 28, 38 | `screenshot: null` on all 4 entries | ℹ️ Info | Intentional placeholder — fallback to bg-brand-gradient is implemented and working; screenshots can be dropped into public/projects/{slug}.{ext} later |
| `src/data/projects.js` | 7, 17, 27, 37 | `liveUrl: null`, `githubUrl: null` on all 4 entries | ℹ️ Info | Intentional placeholder — conditional render guards against null (Projects.js:81-104); no broken UI |
| `src/components/Projects.js` | 3 | `import useInView from '../hooks/useInView'` — path differs from plan spec `'../_shared/useInView'` | ⚠️ Warning | Hook moved to `src/hooks/` rather than `src/_shared/`; import resolves correctly at runtime; plan spec was aspirational |

No blockers found. The two info-level nulls are by design (data drop-in workflow). The warning on hook path is a non-breaking deviation from plan spec.

## Human Verification Required

### 1. Nav Scroll-Spy Active State

**Test:** Open the site in a browser. Scroll slowly through the page. When the Projects section occupies the viewport, verify the "Projects" link in the desktop nav changes to `text-brand` + `border-brand-b-2` styling. On mobile, open the hamburger menu while viewing the Projects section and verify the same active styling.
**Expected:** Projects nav link highlights as active when section is in view; highlight clears when scrolling away.
**Why human:** useActiveSection uses IntersectionObserver — cannot be exercised in static analysis.

### 2. Responsive Card Legibility (dark + light, 3 viewports)

**Test:** In Chrome DevTools, test at iPhone 14 (390px), iPad (768px), and 1440px. Switch between dark and light themes via the ThemeToggle. Verify all four project cards are fully readable: no text overflow, no truncation, sufficient contrast, grid transitions 1→2→3 columns as expected.
**Expected:** 1 column at 390px, 2 columns at 768px, 3 columns at 1440px. Tech chips wrap cleanly. Title and description text legible in both themes.
**Why human:** Responsive layout and theme contrast require browser rendering.

### 3. Brand-Gradient Placeholder and No CLS

**Test:** With all 4 screenshot fields as null, load the page and open Chrome DevTools Performance panel. Record a page load and check CLS score. Verify each card's 16:9 slot shows the brand-gradient with the project title centered in mono font — no broken-image icon, no collapsed height.
**Expected:** CLS = 0 for the Projects section; placeholder renders immediately at correct aspect ratio.
**Why human:** CLS is a runtime metric; static analysis cannot detect layout shift.

## Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All five must-have truths have full implementation evidence at the code level. The three human verification items are runtime-observable behaviors that cannot be confirmed without a browser — they are not expected to fail given the implementation quality, but require confirmation to close the phase as fully passed.

The one notable deviation from plan spec is the useInView hook location (`src/hooks/useInView` instead of `src/_shared/useInView`). This is a non-breaking path change — the hook exists, the import resolves, and the behavior is correct.
